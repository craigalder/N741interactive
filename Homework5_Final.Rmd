## Load dataset in from `car` package

```{r}
library(car)
data(Wong)

library(dplyr)
# add an age group variable
Wong$agegrp <- case_when(
  (Wong$age > 0 & Wong$age <= 10) ~ 1,
  (Wong$age > 10 & Wong$age <= 20) ~ 2,
  (Wong$age > 20 & Wong$age <= 30) ~ 3,
  (Wong$age > 30 & Wong$age <= 40) ~ 4,
  (Wong$age > 40 & Wong$age <= 50) ~ 5,
  (Wong$age > 50 & Wong$age <= 60) ~ 6,
  (Wong$age > 60 & Wong$age <= 70) ~ 7,
  (Wong$age > 70 & Wong$age <= 100) ~ 8)

# convert to factor, add code levels and labels
Wong$agegrp <- factor(Wong$agegrp,
                  levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8),
                  labels = c("Ages 1-10",
                             "Ages 11-10",
                             "Ages 21-10",
                             "Ages 31-10",
                             "Ages 41-10",
                             "Ages 51-10",
                             "Ages 61-70",
                             "Ages 71-100"))
```

1. Make a table of non-parametric statistics (median and IQR) for the number of days and duration grouped by `sex`. You'll be using `summarise()` from the `dplyr` package. For a given variable `x` you'll use `median(x, na.rm=TRUE)`, `quantile(x, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE)`, and `quantile(x, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE)`. Give the table a title using the `caption=` option and update the column names with something nice using the `col.names=` option in the `knitr::kable()` command. 

```{r}
tbl1 <- Wong %>%
group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(Q1days = quantile(days, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE),
            mediandays = median(days, na.rm=TRUE),
            Q3days = quantile(days, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE),
            Q1duration = quantile(duration, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE),
            medianduration = median(duration, na.rm=TRUE),
            Q3duration = quantile(duration, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE))
  
knitr::kable(tbl1,
             col.names=c("Sex",
                         ".25Q Days","Median Days",".75Q Days",
                         ".25Q Duration","Median Duration",
                         ".75Q Duration"),
             caption="Days and Duration by Sex")

```

2.  Make a table of parametric statistics (mean and SD) for the performance outcomes `piq` and `viq` grouped by `sex`. Like the table above, you'll be using `summarise()` from the `dplyr` package. Now you'll use `mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)` and `sd(x, na.rm=TRUE)`. Give the table a title using the `caption=` option and update the column names with something nice using the `col.names=` option in the `knitr::kable()` command. 

```{r}
tbl2 <- Wong %>%
group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(piqmean = mean(piq, na.rm=TRUE),
            piqsd   = sd(piq, na.rm=TRUE),
            viqmean   = mean(viq,na.rm=TRUE),
            viqsd  = sd(viq, na.rm=TRUE))
  
knitr::kable(tbl2,
             col.names=c("Sex",
                         "Math IQ, Mean","Math IQ SD",
                         "Verbal IQ, Mean","Verbal IQ,SD G2"),
             caption="IQ Scores by Sex")
```

3. Make a table containing the frequencies and relative percentages for `agegrp`. Use the example we did in class to help guide you.

```{r}
# find the sample size or number of rows in dataset
ss <- length(Wong$agegrp)

# group by each level of Medu
# find the raw counts using n()
# then compute the relative % by dividing by ss
tbl3 <- Wong %>%
  group_by(agegrp) %>%
  summarise(freq = n(),
            pct = n()*100/ss)

# make a summary table
knitr::kable(tbl3,
             col.names = c("Age Group",
                           "Frequency",
                           "Percent"),
             caption="Frequency Table for Age Group")
```

4. Make a regression model (Model 1) for the performance IQ (`piq`) using `age` and `sex`. Put the regression model results into a table.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(piq~age+sex, data=Wong)
sm1 <- summary(m1)
knitr::kable(sm1$coefficients,
             caption="Model 1: Math IQ regressed on age and sex")
```

5. Make a second regression model (Model 2) for performance IQ (`piq`) using `age` and `sex` plus `days` and `duration`. Put the regression model results into a table.

```{r}
m2 <- lm(piq~age+sex+days+duration, data=Wong)
sm2 <- summary(m1)
knitr::kable(sm2$coefficients,
             caption="Model 1: Math IQ regressed on age, sex, days, duration")
```

6. Finally, make a table showing the results from the `anova()` command comparing Model 1 and Model 2 you made above using the example we did in class as a guide. 

```{r}
anova(m1,m2)
```

7. STUDENT CHOICE - pick either a `htmlwidget` from [http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/) or do a "flexdashboard" using the templates at [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) as a guide.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
# Build the plot
mathIQ_plot <- ggplot(data = Wong, aes(x="Verbal IQ", y="Math IQ")) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=sex), size=2)
mathIQ_plot
ggplotly(mathIQ_plot)
```

Code I tried

{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
# Build the plot
mathIQ_plot <- ggplot(data = Wong, aes(x="Verbal IQ", y="Math IQ")) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=sex), size=2)
mathIQ_plot
ggplotly(mathIQ_plot)
